What's new in BTL 4.4?
/* Copyright Xaef-BTL 2025. All rights reserved */
We removed the boring, space-taking bottom bar in Lightning Browser to provide a clean and wide view, added tab management, devtools, and a search bar. Performance also increased by 20%.
We touched up the Snake Game to give it a bit of a retro feel.
**So what’s coming very soon?**


BTL antivirus (BTLguard) will be added,


Code editor will be added,


The Start menu will become more advanced and modern,


And User management + Login screen will be added.
